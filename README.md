# Hi!👋🏻
My name is Joe Barbere, a passionate software engineer, avid runner, and amateur photographer 🧔🏻‍♂️

As of late, my interests have centered around Python, PyTorch, ML/DL, AMD ROCm/HIP, Microsoft AI Stuff (ONNX, DirectML, Olive), ZLUDA, CUDA/PTX/SASS 😮‍💨

> [!NOTE]
> ROCm PyTorch support is not available yet for Windows 😭 I'm hoping to help contribute to this space 🥷🏻
