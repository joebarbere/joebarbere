# Hi!👋🏻
My name is Joe Barbere, husband to a loving wife, a passionate principal software engineer, and avid runner 🧔🏻‍♂️

As of late, my interests have centered around AMD ROCm/HIP, ZLUDA, CUDA/PTX, ONNX, DirectML, Olive, Python, PyTorch, and Monster Hunter Wilds 🏹

For work I find myself developing in C#, TypeScript, and Terraform; with the following frameworks and libraries: Angular, Electron.NET, Blazor, MudBlazor

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I'm dual-booting Windows 11 and Ubuntu Desktop 24.04.2 LTS because ROCm PyTorch support is just not there yet for Windows. I'm hoping to help contribute to this space by benchmarking and otherwise attempting to test Windows PyTorch ROCm updates with my albeit limited knowledge (hoping to improve in this area soon 💪🏻)
