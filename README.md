# Hi!👋🏻
My name is Joe Barbere, husband to a loving wife, a passionate principal software engineer, and avid runner 🧔🏻‍♂️

As of late, my interests have centered around AMD ROCm/HIP, ZLUDA, CUDA/PTX, ONNX, DirectML, Olive, Python, PyTorch, and Deep Learning

For work I'm currently developing in C#, TypeScript, and Terraform; with the following frameworks and libraries: Angular, Electron.NET, Blazor, MudBlazor
